Description             : Remake of Ultimate Doom.
                          E4M1 speedmaped in about 6 hours long. E4M1 remake in
                          the style of A Doom Odyssey 2022. Since I'm a big fan
                          of the mapping of Kristian Aro, Paul Korfiatis,
                          A2Rob, etc., and my mapping style incorporates a
                          lot from their work, a map like this went
                          naturally.
